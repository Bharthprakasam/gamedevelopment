1. Install Snort

sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort -y

> During install, set your home network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)




---

2. Add a Detection Rule

sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

Add:

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"Ping detected"; sid:1000001;)


---

3. Run Snort

sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

(Replace eth0 with your interface: run ip a to check)

Now in another terminal:

ping <your-IP>

You’ll see an alert in Snort output: "Ping detected"


---

4. Block IP with iptables (manually)

sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <attacker-IP> -j DROP

> Example:



sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.10 -j DROP


---

5. Check Blocked IPs

sudo iptables -L -n


---

6. Remove Block

sudo iptables -D INPUT 1

> (Replace 1 with the correct line number)




---

Let me know if you want to auto-block based on alerts — I can give you a short 3-line script for that too!
